    What is Wild Wikis of the West?
</h2>

<div>
    <p>
        My friends and I have always collected and shared wikipedia articles that we find particularly interesting. This site was created to archive all the strange things we've found over the years.

        If you'd like you know more about how this site was developed and hosted, feel free to check out the <a href="https://github.com/agent-reed/WildWikisWest" class="link blue underline bg-animate hover-bg-light-blue hover-black">code documentation</a>
