linkText: The Dymaxion House was developed by inventor and architect Buckminster Fuller to address several perceived shortcomings with existing homebuilding techniques. Fuller designed several versions of the house at different times â€” all of them factory manufactured kits, assembled on site, intended to be suitable for any site or environment and to use resources efficiently.

### Quote from the article

#### _"The Dymaxion house was intended to reduce water use by a greywater system, a packaging commode, and a "fogger" to replace showers. The fogger was based on efficient compressed-air and water degreasers, but with much smaller water particles to make it comfortable."_
