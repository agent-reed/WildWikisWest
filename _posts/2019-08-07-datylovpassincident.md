## Why it's wild:
#### The "experienced" hikers seem to have left their shelter in a completely illogical fashion
>  "the tent had been cut open from inside, and most of the skiers had fled in socks or barefoot"

#### Inquest from the investigation lists some interesting facts:
> " Journalists reporting on the available parts of the inquest files claim that it states:" 
> - Six of the group members died of hypothermia and three of fatal injuries.
> - There were no indications of other people nearby on Kholat Syakhl apart from the nine travellers.
> - The tent had been ripped open from within.
> - The victims had died 6 to 8 hours after their last meal.
> - Traces from the camp showed that all group members left the campsite of their own accord, on foot.
> - High levels of radiation were found on only one victimâ€™s clothing.
> - To dispel the theory of an attack by the indigenous Mansi people, Vozrozhdenny stated that the fatal injuries of the three bodies could not have been caused by another human being, "because the force of the blows had been too strong and no soft tissue had been damaged"
> - Released documents contained no information about the condition of the skiers' internal organs.
> - There were no survivors of the incident.
