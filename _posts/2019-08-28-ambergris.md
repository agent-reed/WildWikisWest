## Why it's wild:
#### People even like to eat it!
> "A serving of eggs and ambergris was reportedly King Charles II of England's favorite dish."

#### Evidence that massive squids attack sperm whales
>   "Because the beaks of giant squids have been discovered within lumps of ambergris, scientists have theorized that the substance is produced by the whale's gastrointestinal tract to ease the passage of hard, sharp objects that it may have eaten."
