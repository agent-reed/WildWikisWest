# What is Wild Wikis of the West

My friends and I have always collected and shared wikipedia articles that we find particularly interesting. This site was created to archive all the strange things we've found over the years. If you would have a WILD wiki you would like to see on the site, feel free to submit one here.

If you'd like you know more about how this site was developed and hosted, feel free to check out the code documentation

Enjoy!
